# certbot-output-cert-to-terminal
Bash script to output cert / priv key / chain .pem files to terminal after creation, a quick win for reducing repetition.

####Why
I found this task quite repetitive every 3 months, this script just outputs
the generated certificates to the terminal for copy and pasting, a tiny bit 
more useful than pulling them out seperately, and navigating through them.


####My enviroment
- OSX El Capitan
- Bash

####Disclaimer
Sorry, I can't be held liable for any problems this script may cause to your system,
even though it's highly unlikely.

    Usage: sh output.sh www.domain.com
